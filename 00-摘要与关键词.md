# 小吃创业网络教育系统前端设计与实现

## 摘要

随着改革开放的深入、社会的发展进步，“互联网+”理念在传统行业的逐步深化，为响应李克强总理“大众创业，万众创新”的口号，各路有志青年不断投身自主创业。在众多的领域中，小吃创业是机遇与挑战并存的创业方向之一。本课题从“小吃创业网络教育系统前端设计与实现”方向入手，分析了在当前行业大背景下，小吃创业的机遇与挑战，总结出小吃创业行业的通用需求，并详细讲解了小吃创业网络教育系统的前端设计与实现方法。

本小吃创业网络教育系统包括三个端的产品，分别是：PC端网站、手机端Web网站（Web App）以及混合开发式的手机客户端（Android手机客户端）。为了适应三端产品不同的技术特点，我们选用了三套不尽相同的技术组合来分别实现该系统三端产品的前端部分。虽说技术组合不尽相同，但前端技术说到底还是离不开HTML（HTML5）、CSS（CSS3）、JavaScript（ECMAScript 2015）基础，再结合优秀的开源框架和开源库，最终形成以小吃信息资讯、教育培训、分享交流为一体的小吃创业辅导垂直平台，帮助创业人才在小吃餐饮行业成功创业，提升中小餐饮企业管理水平，传播中华饮食文化。
